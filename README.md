# sqlite3pdf
a PDF containing the documentation from sqlite.org

The PDF create is not complete yet, things TODO:
- internal link should point to this PDF, and not to internet.
- An index at the start of the PDF
- Some missing images in 'fileio' (see: https://sqlite.org/fileio.html)
- Some missing HTML, like: https://sqlite.org/syntax/alter-table-stmt.html

Software used:

- wkhtmltox  - https://wkhtmltopdf.org/
- gawk       - https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/
- Windows 10 - microsoft.com ... (because those linux-guys do not want a PDF, for sure ðŸ˜‰)
